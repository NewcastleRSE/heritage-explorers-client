  <h3>British Museum</h3>

  <div class="box sb3">Hello, yes, you there. Do you have your ticket? Only visitors with a ticket can enter the British Museum. Wait, how old are you? We don’t normally allow children here but I suppose you are ok. I am your guide today - you aren’t allowed to explore on your own of course. Welcome, welcome everyone to the first room. Can you find all the objects?
